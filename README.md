Personal Web Page Design and Development
This project was developed to create my personal web page. The web page was designed to showcase my software development skills, engineering background, and technical background. Important elements such as modern web design trends, user-friendly interface, and performance optimization were taken into consideration in the project.

Technical Features:
HTML5 and CSS3
The basic structure of the web page was created with HTML5. Semantic HTML tags were used in the page structure.
The page visuality was created with CSS3 and a structure suitable for modern web design in terms of style and visuality was aimed.
Responsive (Mobile Compatibility)
With CSS media queries, the page design was made compatible so that it can be displayed properly on different screen sizes. In this way, the user experience on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices was optimized.
Animations and Hover Effects
Animations such as growth, shrinkage and color change in hover states of images and boxes have been added with the transform and transition CSS properties.

These animations increase user interaction and provide visual appeal.
Visual Optimization
The brightness levels of the images have been increased with the filter feature and made eye-catching.
Visual sizes have been optimized for page performance.
Social Media Integration
Social media icons have been added to the page using the FontAwesome library. These icons allow users to quickly access social media accounts such as LinkedIn and GitHub.
UI/UX Design
A simple and user-friendly interface has been designed. Page elements and content are clearly listed, allowing users to easily navigate the page.
CSS Shadowing and Transitions
By using box-shadow and text-shadow, depth has been added to page elements and a modern visual effect has been created.
